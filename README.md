###Just a girl who fell in love with coding, and yes, I "rust" in peace! 😉

About Me:

  - 🌱 I’m currently using Rust — Yes, I like my coffee black and my programming languages powerful!
  - 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on open source projects where I can grow my skills and help out!
  - 🤔 I’m looking for help with everything Rust, because you know, it's not just a layer on old iron!
  - 💬 Ask me about why I love Rust, my journey into tech, or the last book I read.
  - 📫 How to reach me: [My LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chaimajaballah/)
  - ⚡ Fun tidbit: I ventured from the realms of applied mathematics and data science into the enchanted forest of full-stack development, crafting potions with Rust, and occasionally weaving magic in freelance projects
